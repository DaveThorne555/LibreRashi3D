# LibreRashi3D

Decided to break my years long hiatus to give something back to the omorashi community that I lurked in way back in 2015. I made this for the love of adult animation. It's going to be a year or two before AI takes over animation and game development at the time of this writing. This blend file runs a game if open on UPBGE 3.0.0 then by pressing the P button while your mouse cursor is near the character on the big window. In other blender software you might just be left with a weird animation. Feel free to scan it with antivirus or open it as a text file before use. It will neither bite nor execute. All content here is open source under UPBGE's GPLv3 license. The model is just a random character made with Vroid Beta and exported using the CC0 license option with textures edited using Krita and GIMP. No need to credit me to use any of the stuff made here. Textures are CC0 license too. Also I don't have any patreon or monero or GoFundMe or anything like that so don't pay the scammers. I never ask for money and never will. Turning this into something to use with Blend4Web is left as an exercise for the next user. See Releases for files.
